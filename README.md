# Welcome to trexplot

By Hamish Robertson & Tan Benjakul

We aim to deliver a lo-fi plotting experience to Toughreactmech output files.

## To pip install

`pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ trexplot==1`

But I dont think it works well yet

## To get stuff to work stuff

Move the TestFiles folder somewhere else

cd into there

run `python ../Trexplot/trexplot`

or ipython or something similar

Have a look at the trex_fig_return.py script to get an idea how it works.

I'll try and finish the pip install and this documentation more on saturday. For the moment I'm sure you can figure some bits out. I'd appreciate some rapid feedback that this all works

Also fiona wanted stuff like the ability to log variables
